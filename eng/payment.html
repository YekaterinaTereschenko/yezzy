                <h3>PAYMENT</h3>
                <p>Footwear available in Ukraine will be shipped within 1-2 days using "Nova Poshta" service with the option of cash on delivery or full prepayment based on the provided details. When using the cash on delivery service, the buyer pays a commission of 2% of the product's value, as well as delivery costs according to "Nova Poshta" tariffs. Courier delivery by "Nova Poshta" is also possible; however, according to the service rules, the courier delivers the goods to the buyer before payment, without the possibility of fitting. In case the paid product does not fit, we are ready to exchange it for another or refund the money. Orders from other countries are fully paid in advance, and the price is fixed at the time of ordering.</p>

            <div class="payment-block">
                <h3>RETURN AND EXCHANGE</h3>
                <p>You can return or exchange the product within 14 days from the date of purchase if the product has not been used and retains its commercial appearance, internal and hanging tags, original box, and purchase receipt (if any). Footwear ordered from another country is subject to exchange and return. To arrange a return or exchange, please contact us by any convenient method.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="payment-block">
                <h3>CHANGE OR CANCELLATION OF ORDER</h3>
                <p>If the footwear you ordered is already in Ukraine and has not been shipped, you can change or cancel your order. However, if the pair has already been purchased for your order and is in the process of delivery, changes or cancellations will be impossible.</p>

            <div class="payment-block">
                <h3>DELIVERY TIMES</h3>
                <p>Delivery times are determined by the location of the goods. If the goods are in stock in Ukraine, delivery will take 1-3 days, in Poland - 5-8 days, in America - 9-15 days. Usually, delivery times may vary due to customs control procedures. Delivery within Ukraine is carried out by "Nova Poshta" service.</p>
