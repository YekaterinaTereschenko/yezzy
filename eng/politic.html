            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Privacy Policy concerns the personal data that customers provide to the Company, both in the context
                of providing various services and other communication, typically in electronic form, as well as in the
                context
                of promotions, customer service, and after-sales service. <br> <br>

                The Company reserves the right to change and supplement the existing provisions of the Privacy Policy,
                and
                such changes and supplements will take precedence over the existing provisions of the Policy. It should
                be noted that
                the services provided may contain links to third-party websites that have their own privacy policies.
                In such cases, the Company is not responsible for the content of the third party's privacy policy or for
                compliance with its provisions.
                By providing their personal data, the Client fully agrees
                to the processing of their personal data in accordance with the provisions of the current Privacy Policy
                of the Company. <br> <br>

                Procedure for collecting, storing, and disposing of personal data <br> <br>

                The Company collects personal data only with the consent of the customer and only for the purpose of
                providing the customer with a service or
                service that requires the provision of personal data: purchase in an online store, participation in
                promotions, warranty
                service and maintenance. Various information security measures are applied (both technical and
                organizational) to prevent leakage
                of customer personal data. <br> <br>

                The maximum storage period for customer personal data is 75 years from the date of receipt by the
                company
                of private information. Otherwise, the company will store the customer's personal data until the end of
                its activity. <br> <br>

                Personal data or its parts must be destroyed, anonymized, or blocked to prevent further
                processing of this information. <br> <br>

                The Company collects personal data of the following categories of customers: <br> <br>

                Technical information: <br> <br>

                access time and IP address; <br> <br>

                Sources of access to the Company's Internet resources; <br> <br>

                Websites visited by the user; <br> <br>

                types of advertising panels; <br> <br>

                other technical information provided by the user's browser; <br> <br>

                Customer's phone number (when calling the numbers indicated on the Company's website). <br> <br>

                During registration on the site, the Company collects the customer's personal data for user
                authentication /
                service personalization / order delivery / customer feedback: <br> <br>

                User activity information: <br> <br>

                Information about agreements/contracts between the customer and the company; <br> <br>

                Information about inquiries and orders addressed to the company; <br> <br>

                Purposes of processing customer personal data: <br> <br>

                Sell products and provide other services to customers; <br> <br>

                Take into account the wishes of customers (when developing a new product or service); <br> <br>

                Inform the customer about promotions, discounts, and special offers by email and SMS; <br> <br>

                To provide customers with feedback. <br> <br>

                Do not transfer customer personal data to third parties, except in the following cases: <br> <br>

                obtain explicit consent from the user to provide his personal data to a third party; <br> <br>

                at the request of law enforcement agencies in accordance with applicable law; <br> <br>

                merger or acquisition by the company. <br> <br>

                Use of cookies and tabs <br> <br>

                Cookies allow us to collect the following information about the customer: IP address / operating system
                / type
                browser / URL of the referring website. This is necessary to improve the services that the company
                provides to the customer
                (remembering the password on the site when closing the browser, traffic analysis, etc.). If you wish,
                you can at any
                time prevent tracking your activity by disabling cookies. <br> <br>

                User rights regarding personal data <br> <br>

                All customers can edit their personal data in the User's Cabinet. If the user expresses a desire
                to stop processing their personal data, they must contact the company.
