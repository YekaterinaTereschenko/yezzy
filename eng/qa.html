                <h3>Why does the price change?</h3>
                <p>The price on the website changes in parallel with the market and may increase or decrease depending on various factors, including the demand for a specific size during a certain period and the exchange rate. The order is fixed at the price indicated on the website at the time of placing the order, regardless of subsequent price changes.</p>

                <h3>Is there a risk of receiving a fake when purchasing?</h3>
                <p>By ordering from us, you minimize the risk of receiving a non-original product. We purchase sneakers at the release stage from "Adidas," and only after that, we consider the possibility of purchasing on trading platforms. Even in such cases, to place a sales ad, we go through a detailed authentication of the footwear. Additionally, upon arrival at our warehouse, we thoroughly check it for authenticity. Your safety and satisfaction with the purchase are our priority.</p>

                <h3>How does the exchange process work?</h3>
                <p>If the color or size does not suit you, you can exchange the item. It is important to note that no more than 14 days have passed since the purchase, the product has not been used, has been kept in its original condition, has all internal and hanging tags, the original box, and the purchase receipt (if any). Sneakers ordered on demand are not subject to exchange and return.</p>

                <h3>How does the return process work?</h3>

Sneakers purchased on demand are not subject to exchange and return. To process the return, contact us by any convenient method.</p>
